      <p> 22/4: The incident. Not knowing better, I told Zelda your grade. And worse, I even compared it, downplaying the achievements youve had. even making you feel worse, 
                on top of the copius amounts of stress you must have been facing, dealing with the finals of such a compeitive H3. These actions were simply unjustifiable, and even
                as a joke, these jokes were in bad taste. As a friend, I should have been more sensitive to such information and such distasteful jokes should have never crossed my mind. 
                I apologise. I promise to do better.

      <p> 23/4 - Present: After my lapse in judgement, it was compounded with a lack of care on my part. From a lackluster apology to a lack of follow up, my actions after simply were 
          inadequete to make up for the massive mistake that I had committed. To be frank, I fucked up once, and I was scared of fucking up twice with another inadequate attempt to apologise.
          And for this, Im sorry. I promise to do better.

    <h2>Apology</h2>

    <p>Dear Rachael</p>
    <p>I am writing this letter because I owe you more than a rushed or half-hearted apology. What I did was wrong, and the way I handled things afterwards just 
      made it worse. Ive spent a lot of time reflecting on my actions, and I just wanted to you to know that I truly am sorry. Not just for my words, but how I failed as a friend, 
      using thoughtless jokes and careless words right when you needed support most. I am truly sorry for my actions, or lack thereof. I know that these words cannot undo the pain
      I've caused but I hope this letter conveys the depth of my regret and my commitment to rebuilding this friendship.  </p>

    <p> Over the past few weeks, I've spent a lot of time reflecting on the gravity of my actions. I feek immense regret and dissapointment in myself. You trusted me with your grade, 
    and I violated your trust by just sharing it with a stranger I just met. Even worse, I made thoughtless and irresponssible comparisons which just downplayed your achievements.  
    Furthermore, at such a stressful time, where you had to lockin for finals, my actions just added unnecessary stress and hurt when you least needed it. While I wish I could say it 
    is cliche to say that that moment kept replaying in my head, this event still haunts me, even in my nightmares. This jokes were simply insensitive and showed a complete lack of 
    consideration for your feelings. As your friend, this is simply unacceptable and I promise to do better. </p>

    <p> Even worse, following the incident, my intiaial apology while sincere, was simply inadqueate. I failed to properly acknowledge the gravity of my actions and its implications, failing
      to check up on you or showing my remorse. Truth is, I was ashamed and paralyzed by fear. After such a fuck up, I was honestly scared of making things even worse with a insufficient 
      attempt at apology. Yet, my silence and avoidacne were simply just as hurtful as my initail acitons. For this, I am wrong, and I promise to do better. </p>

    <p> This friendship truly means a lot to me, and the thought that my own foolishness has damaged it simply is regretful. I completely understand if you need time or space, and I will respect
       whatever boundaries you need to set. When and if youre ready, I would more than welcome the opportunity to talk and in persona and apologise face-to-face. If there is anything I can do to
       make it right, do let me know. Regardsless, I promise that I've learnt from this, and I promise to be a more considerate friend, such that similar events will never happen again. </p>

    <p>I am truly sorry.</p>

    <p>With Greatest Regret, </p>

    <p>Your sorry friend</p>

    <p>Tedrick</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>My heartfelt regrets and due apology.<h3>
    <h4>This letter is filled with sincere emotions and a cascade of falling crying face emojis, symbolizing my heartfelt apology and immense regret
    </h4>



    <p>Dear Rachael,</p>

    <p>As I pen down these words, I find myself immersed in a sea of emotions, navigating the currents of our shared
      journey. Each stroke of the pen feels like a brush on the canvas of our story, painting a vivid picture of love,
      growth, and understanding.</p>

    <p>From the moment our paths first crossed to the challenges we faced and overcame, every chapter of our journey has
      etched itself into the tapestry of our shared existence. The laughter, the tears, the quiet moments â€” they all
      contribute to the symphony of our connection.</p>

    <p>Your presence in my life is like a gentle breeze, comforting and invigorating. Through the highs and lows, your
      unwavering support has been my anchor, grounding me in the warmth of our shared love.</p>

    <p>As we traverse the uncharted territories of life, I want you to know the profound impact you've had on my soul.
      Your essence is woven into the very fabric of who I am, and I am endlessly grateful for the depth of our
      connection.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being my confidant, my partner, and my greatest source of joy. With each passing day, my love for
      you deepens, and I look forward to the countless moments we have yet to create together.</p>

    <p>With regret,</p>
    <p>aiaiiaia</p>
