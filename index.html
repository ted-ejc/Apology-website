      <p> 22/4: The incident. Not knowing better, I told Zelda your grade. And worse, I even compared it, downplaying the achievements youve had. even making you feel worse, 
                on top of the copius amounts of stress you must have been facing, dealing with the finals of such a compeitive H3. These actions were simply unjustifiable, and even
                as a joke, these jokes were in bad taste. As a friend, I should have been more sensitive to such information and such distasteful jokes should have never crossed my mind. 
                I apologise. I promise to do better.

      <p> 23/4 - Present: After my lapse in judgement, it was compounded with a lack of care on my part. From a lackluster apology to a lack of follow up, my actions after simply were 
          inadequete to make up for the massive mistake that I had committed. To be frank, I fucked up once, and I was scared of fucking up twice with another inadequate attempt to apologise.
          And for this, Im sorry. I promise to do better.

    <h2>Apology</h2>

    <p>Dear ABC,...</p>
    <p>I am truly sorry for my actions...</p>

    <p>I hope this message finds you, even if it's in a moment of uncertainty. I've spent a lot of time reflecting on
      us, on our journey together, and the gravity of my actions. I want to sincerely apologize for any pain I may have
      caused you.</p>

    <p>Our journey, marked by countless shared moments and memories, holds a special place in my heart. From the
      laughter that echoed through the years to the quiet moments that spoke volumes, each step we took together was a
      testament to the love I feel for you.</p>

    <p>I want you to know that my love for you has always been unwavering. In the midst of challenges and
      misunderstandings, it remains a constant force in my life. I cherish the unique bond we share, and the thought of
      losing that connection is something I cannot bear.</p>

    <p>I recognize and take full responsibility for the mistakes I've made. They were never a reflection of my feelings
      for you but rather a lapse in judgment. I'm committed to learning from these errors and doing the necessary work
      to rebuild the trust that may have been shaken.</p>

    <p>As I express these sentiments, I want you to feel the depth of my remorse and the sincerity of my love. You are
      an integral part of my life, and the thought of causing you pain is a heavy burden that I carry. I am truly sorry.
    </p>

    <p>I understand that words alone may not be enough, but I am willing to do whatever it takes to make amends. Your
      happiness and our connection mean the world to me.</p>

    <p>I respect the space you need, and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk. Our journey is a story worth fighting
      for, and I am committed to making it one filled with love, understanding, and growth.</p>

    <p>With all my love,</p>

    <h3>A Symphony of Apology from My Falling Heart</h3>
    <h4>This letter is filled with sincere emotions and a cascade of falling hearts, symbolizing my heartfelt apology.
    </h4>



    <p>Dear ABC,</p>

    <p>As I pen down these words, I find myself immersed in a sea of emotions, navigating the currents of our shared
      journey. Each stroke of the pen feels like a brush on the canvas of our story, painting a vivid picture of love,
      growth, and understanding.</p>

    <p>From the moment our paths first crossed to the challenges we faced and overcame, every chapter of our journey has
      etched itself into the tapestry of our shared existence. The laughter, the tears, the quiet moments â€” they all
      contribute to the symphony of our connection.</p>

    <p>Your presence in my life is like a gentle breeze, comforting and invigorating. Through the highs and lows, your
      unwavering support has been my anchor, grounding me in the warmth of our shared love.</p>

    <p>As we traverse the uncharted territories of life, I want you to know the profound impact you've had on my soul.
      Your essence is woven into the very fabric of who I am, and I am endlessly grateful for the depth of our
      connection.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being my confidant, my partner, and my greatest source of joy. With each passing day, my love for
      you deepens, and I look forward to the countless moments we have yet to create together.</p>

    <p>Forever yours,</p>
    <p>Your Love</p>
